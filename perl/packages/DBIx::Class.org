#+TITLE: DBIx::Class notes
* Glossary:
** Object Relational Mapper (ORM):
    what is an ORM? .... an ORM is a way to translate database rows/relations ... etc to constructs that are considered native to a certain programming language, and these constructs are usually objects.
    An ORM is a piece of software that maps database tables/rows to classes and objects, usually a database table is represented by a class and different operations of certain table that are usually done with a certain query language such as SQL are defined as methods of that class.
    By mapping database tables to classes, instances of these classes/tables will represent a subset of the table that you can customize however you see fit. Note that a centeral part of any good ORM is that it can still relate different instances of a class which are representations of rows to where their original location is in the original databse.
    With tables represented as classes and customizable subsets of these tables are accessable as objects/instances of these classes, there is limitless posibilities to how to CRUD a certain database, enough possibilies to fit every taste and need for how to interact with a database without having to write or maintain code in a database specific query language.
** DBIx::Class:
    in the perl programming language the most common interface used to interact with a database is the DBI module by Tim Bunce. DBI mapped the basic interaction with a database independent of its type to perl syntax. Its richness provided a great way to interact with databases but it didn't target ease of use. Which meant that we still needed a way to interact with a database in a flexable way removing the need to learn another syntax and take the richness of DBI and build on top of it to be flexable, extensible and most importantly progressive. DBIx::Class comes to the rescue as it not only inherent from DBI and adapts its richness and robust API but also it provided a layer that made database interactions far more easier that of DBI and allowed for flexibality when writing data related code.
** Schema:
    DBIx term for "Model" in the MVC pattern! it refers to the class that maps the table directly. NOTE: you'll see the statement "gerenating schemas" get thrown around a lot, it refers to the idea of generating =.pm= files out of a database
** Different Schemas generated:
*** =Result= Class:
    a Class whose instances/objects represet a single result from a ResultSet, it often represents only a single row from a database.
*** =ResultSet= Class:
    =DBIx::Class::ResultSet= represet a database query including all of the conditions/clauses, the simplest form of this class is the entire table. 
*** =Row= Class:
    =DBIx::Class::Row= represents a single component of a =ResultSet= or =Result= class, which means its a single row or parts of a single row as dictated by the =ResultSet= or =Result= classes. delete and update operations are invoked on objects of this type.
* Creating Result Classes:
  you can either create result classes by hand or you can let =DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader= take care of generating your classes for you from an existing database.
  here is an example command of how you can do that:

  =perl -MDBIx::Class::Schema::Loader=make_schema_at,dump_to_dir:./lib -e 'make_schema_at("Breadcrumbs::Schema", { debug => 1 }, [ "dbi:mysql:dbname=Breadcrumbs","user", "passwd" ])'=
